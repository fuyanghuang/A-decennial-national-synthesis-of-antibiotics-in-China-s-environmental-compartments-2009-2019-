This repository contains the R script and data. Statistical analyses were conducted by R Statistical Software v3.5.1.

Data of antibiotics were extracted from 172 previous reports that antibiotics were detected in waters, sediments and soil in China during 2009–2019 to develop a database, including compound name, sampling location, concentration, environmental media of the sample, and reference information.

The database contains a total of 18,350 concentration values of 115 antibiotics.

Abstract
The potential threat of antibiotics to the environment and human health has raised significant concerns in recent years. China is the largest producer and user of antibiotics in the world, possibly resulting in the high detection frequencies and concentrations of antibiotics in the environment. Clear status on the occurrence and distribution of antibiotic contamination in the Chinese environment is needed to gain insight for both research and regulatory needs (e.g. monitoring, control, and management). This paper collects information from over 170 reports on the occurrence of antibiotics in the environment of China. A total of 110 antibiotics were found and 28 core antibiotics were ubiquitous in China in almost all compartments of the environment, excluding the atmosphere. In aqueous phase, the ranges of median values were 0.01-1,247 ng/L in animal wastewater, 0.8-154.5 ng/L in WWTP (wastewater treatment plant) effluent, 0.8-48.6 ng/L in surface water, 0.2-28.7 ng/L in groundwater, respectively. In solid phase, the residual levels of antibiotics were approximately 1-100,000 μg/kg in manure, 0.1-10,000 μg/kg in WWTP sludge, 0.0110,000 μg/kg in sediment, and 0.1-100 μg/kg in soil. Seven dominant antibiotics in all environment compartments are identified by cluster analyses, including tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Meanwhile, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethazine are also frequently detected in the aqueous phase. Among the main basins, the Haihe River Basin showed higher median concentrations of antibiotics in surface water while the Huaihe River Basin exhibited higher median concentrations for most antibiotics in sediment. Based on the number of detected antibiotics in various environmental compartments, animal farms and WWTP are the main sources of antibiotics, and surface water and sediment are the main receptors of antibiotics. Compared to the receptors, the median values of antibiotic concentrations in the sources are one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of the receptors, whether in the solid phase or in the aqueous phase.
