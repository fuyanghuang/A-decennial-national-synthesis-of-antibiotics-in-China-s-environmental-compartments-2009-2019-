Data of antibiotics were extracted from 172 previous reports that antibiotics were detected in waters, sediments and soil in China during 2009–2019 to develop a database, including compound name, sampling location, concentration, environmental media of the sample, and reference information.
The database contains a total of 18,350 concentration values of 115 antibiotics.
